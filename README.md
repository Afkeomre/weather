# Weather Search Application 🔆

This is a simple weather search application that allows users to input a city name and receive the current weather conditions for that location. The user interface is designed with a responsive layout and includes a search bar, error messages for invalid inputs, and a visual display of the weather data.

## Features ✔️

- **Search Functionality**: the app allows users to enter the name of a city to search for current weather conditions.
- **Weather Display**: displays the current temperature, weather conditions, location, and date.
- **Error Handling**: shows an error message if the search input is invalid or if the location cannot be found.
- **Dynamic Themes**: the website automatically changes the background image and button color based on the temperature. There are two themes: a "cold" theme for low temperatures and a "warm" theme for higher temperatures.
- **Responsive Design**: the layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
